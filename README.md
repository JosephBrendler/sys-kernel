# sys-kernel
sources for sys-kernel packages such as kernelupdate, kernel-images, etc.

3/22/2025 - began migrating packages from myUtilities to multiple logically categorized repositories.  New package versions will be added here, and the old version will be maintained in myUtilities until all older versions of the packages have been retired.  This will enable older ebuilds in the joetoo repository to continue to work unmodified, while newer ebuilds will be created to source the package from here.
